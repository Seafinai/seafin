## Market Narrative

### The Story We Tell (SMB Focus)

"**The $254B SMB Opportunity**

SMBs are underserved. Completely.

Enterprise vendors focus on enterprise. Cheap vendors deliver cheap results.

But SMBs have real problems that AI can solve:
- Support teams drowning in repetitive questions
- Leads going to competitors while the owner sleeps
- Legacy systems that don't talk to modern tools
- Budgets tight, time tighter

They need partners who understand SMB reality:
- Not $50k budgets. $5-25k budgets.
- Not 6-month projects. 4-8 week sprints.
- Not vendor BS. Results you can measure.
- Not hiring expensive consultants. Affordable partners.

**Seafin navigates SMBs through AI transformation.**

Custom AI agents. Affordable consulting. Products that work.

Results in weeks. Pricing that makes sense.

No BS. Just solutions."
