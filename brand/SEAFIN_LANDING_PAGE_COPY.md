---

## HERO SECTION

### Headline (Above the Fold)
> **Custom AI for small business. Results in weeks, not months.**

### Subheading
> You know your business needs AI. You can't afford $50k projects or $200/hr consultants. Seafin is different.

**We build custom AI agents for SMBs:**
- Solve your specific problem (not generic workflows)
- Delivered in 4-8 weeks (not 6 months)
- $5-25k investment (not $50k+)
- Trusted advisor support (not vendor BS)

### Call-to-Action (Primary)
**"Book a free 15-minute strategy call"** or **"See pricing"**

---

## PROBLEM SECTION (Hero Alternative)

### Headline
> **You Need AI. But You Can't Afford Enterprise Prices.**

### Three Key Problems SMBs Face:

**Problem 1: You're losing time on repetitive work**
> Your team spends hours daily on tasks that an AI agent could handle in seconds. Qualifying leads, answering FAQs, processing documents. That's money walking out the door.

**Problem 2: You can't hire an AI engineer**
> AI expertise costs $150k+ per year. You don't have that budget. But you need someone who knows AI to help.

**Problem 3: You're stuck between two bad options**
> Expensive consultants ($200/hr) or cheap freelancers (risky). Neither works for SMBs.

### Transition
> **What if you could get custom AI solutions at prices that make sense?**
