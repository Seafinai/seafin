**Lead with:** Expertise, results, and case studies
**Tone:** Professional, authoritative, approachable

**Website structure (seafin.ai):**
```
seafin.ai
├── Hero: "Custom AI for small business"
├── Services (BUILD / AUTOMATE / CONNECT / PROTECT)
├── Case studies / results
├── About / team
├── Solvity callout ("Try our self-service platform →")
└── Contact / discovery call CTA
```

### Solvity: Product-First
**Lead with:** The product experience and capabilities
**Mention:** "by Seafin" in footer
**Tone:** Modern, clean, action-oriented

**Website structure (solvity.ai):**
```
solvity.ai
├── Hero: Product demo / value prop
├── Skills library
├── Pricing tiers ($59-$299/mo)
├── How it works
├── Custom solutions ("Need something tailored? →")
└── Footer: "by Seafin" + company links
```

## Visual Identity

### Seafin
- **Primary:** Deep navy / ocean blue (trust, depth, expertise)
- **Accent:** Teal (growth, AI, forward-thinking)
- **Typography:** Clean sans-serif (Inter)
- **Logo:** Seafin wordmark + favicon

### Solvity
- **Primary:** TBD (should feel distinct from Seafin but complementary)
- **Style:** Modern SaaS aesthetic, lighter and more energetic than Seafin
- **Typography:** TBD

---

## Key Decisions

### Decision: Two-Brand Architecture
**Why separate Seafin and Solvity:**
- Services and products have different audiences and buying motions
- Product-first branding for SaaS (users care about the product, not the consulting company)
- Keeps Seafin consulting brand authoritative and premium
- Solvity can scale independently as a product
- Follows successful SaaS playbook (Accenture has Avanade, etc.)

### Decision: Custodian Under Seafin PROTECT Pillar
**Why Custodian stays with Seafin:**
- Custodian is a managed service, not a self-service SaaS product
- Fits naturally under the PROTECT service pillar
- Delivered and supported by the Seafin team
- If it evolves into a self-service product, could move under Solvity later

### Decision: Product-First for Solvity
**Why lead with product, not company:**
- Users bond with product name, not holding company
- Easier to build brand equity for the platform
- Simpler to market and position independently
- "by Seafin" provides credibility without cluttering the product brand
